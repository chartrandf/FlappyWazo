# FlappyWazo (Plugin)

This is a simple demonstration of a [forked Flappy Bird game](https://github.com/barzin144/FlappyBird), now converted into a [Wazo Plugin for Portal or Apps](https://wazo-communication.github.io/euc-plugins-js-sdk/docs/plugins/introduction). The purpose of this project is to illustrate how plugins works in our products and let's people knowns that the only limit is your imagination with our plugin system.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
